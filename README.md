# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of GDP and life expectancy (LEABY) data for various countries from 2000 to 2015. The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship between a country's economic performance (measured by GDP) and the health of its population (measured by life expectancy).

## Overview

The analysis is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the data:

1. **GDP Distribution**: Understanding the distribution of GDP across different countries.
2. **LEABY Distribution**: Examining the distribution of life expectancy.
3. **Average GDP and LEABY by Country**: Comparing average GDP and life expectancy across countries.
4. **GDP and LEABY Distribution by Country**: Visualizing the distribution of GDP and life expectancy within each country.
5. **Trends Over Time**: Analyzing GDP and life expectancy trends over the years.
6. **GDP and LEABY Relationship**: Investigating the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.

## Data

The data used for this analysis includes GDP and life expectancy values for various countries from the years 2000 to 2015. The data is sourced from reliable global economic and health databases.

## Visualizations

The notebook contains several visualizations to help understand the data better:

- Histograms for GDP and LEABY distributions.
- Bar plots for average GDP and LEABY by country.
- Violin and swarm plots for GDP and LEABY distributions by country.
- Line plots for GDP and LEABY trends over time.
- Scatter plots with linear regression to examine the relationship between GDP and LEABY.

## Key Findings

1. **GDP Distribution**: Most countries have lower GDPs, with a few having significantly higher values.
2. **LEABY Distribution**: Life expectancy is generally higher, with most countries having life expectancies between 75 and 80 years.
3. **Average GDP and LEABY by Country**: The United States has the highest average GDP, while Zimbabwe has the lowest. Higher GDPs are generally associated with higher life expectancies.
4. **Trends Over Time**: GDP and life expectancy have generally increased over the years for most countries.
5. **GDP and LEABY Relationship**: There is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights a clear relationship between a country's economic performance and the health of its population. Wealthier countries tend to have higher life expectancies. However, the variations within and between countries suggest that other factors also play crucial roles in determining health outcomes.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

- **Investigate Other Factors**: Include variables like healthcare quality, education, environmental conditions, and social stability.
- **Country-Specific Analysis**: Detailed analysis for each country to identify unique influencing factors.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Detailed time series analysis to identify specific events or policies affecting GDP and LEABY trends.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare countries with similar GDPs but different life expectancies to identify effective policies or practices.

## How to Use

To run the analysis yourself:

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gdp-life-expectancy-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
    ```bash
    cd gdp-life-expectancy-analysis
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook GDP_LEABY_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
